# head-body-analysis
The app focuses on using the Vision framework to analyze human images.  <br />
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/ <br />

The framework offers a quite range of possibilities, in this project, I have examined the following: <br />
- The number of faces visible in the image. <br />
- The accessories detected around the head. <br />
- Quality of the face capture <br />
- Visible body parts in the image. <br />
